This folder contains example simulation parameters and results to use for MCDA_code.py. These are based on scenarios described in Chapters 3 and 5 of the dissertation.   

* <b>All_parameters.txt</b> contains parameters for "base scenario" and "low demand" runs. The results of the base scenario runs, generated by running each set of parameters through LCA_model.py, are found in <b>simulation_results_all.csv</b>. The results of the low demand runs are found in <b>simulation_results_low_demand.csv</b>
* <b>Const_CO2_parameters.txt</b> contains parameters for "atmospheric CO2 concentration" runs. The results of these runs, as generated with LCA_model.py, are found in <b>simulation_results_CO2.csv</b>.
* <b>Heat_Wave_parameters.txt</b> contains parameters for the "heat wave" runs. The results of these runs, as generated with LCA_model.py, are found in <b>simulation_results_heat_wave.csv</b>.
